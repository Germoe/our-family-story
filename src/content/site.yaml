  people:
    - name: "Brett"
      title: "Operations Management Professional & Lifelong Planner"
      bio: "Brett works in operations management, where he enjoys improving processes and bringing a sense of calm and order to everyday life. A natural organizer with an A-type streak, he also loves board games, road trips, live concerts and musicals, and traveling to visit friends and family abroad.\n\n Growing up in a small town in western New York and later falling in love with city life helped shape who Brett is today—someone who enjoys the energy of the city but is just as happy getting out in nature to hike, bike, or kayak. He’s always known he wanted to be a parent and feels deeply grateful to be at a place in life where he’s ready for that responsibility. Even more, he’s ready to parent alongside a steady and loving partner who balances him in all the best ways."
      quote: "I’ve always thought of family as something beyond blood, and home as more than the building we live in — it’s the love, the support, the adventures and the life we build together."

    - name: "Sebastian"
      title: "Data Scientist & Curious Explorer"
      bio: "I love figuring things out—whether that’s a deep technical project or a brand-new adventure. Curiosity shapes how I work, learn, and move through the world. \n\n Outside of work, I’m happiest hiking, bouldering, or spending time near the water (swimming, diving, snorkeling, or - soon - sailing). I deeply value time with family and friends and the small, everyday moments we share. I look forward to sharing all sorts of family and friends around BBQs in the backyard or Bills Games. The Arts and Music are a big part of my life too, and I can already picture dancing around the living room with a little kiddo to Brandi Carlile, Taylor Swift, or Chappell Roan—and maybe even taking them to their first concert someday."
      quote: "I hope to create a life filled with curiosity, adventure, music, and lots of love for a child. I am most excited to find out who our child wants to be and help them figure that out along the way."
